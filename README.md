# NYC_taxi_trip_duration

Predicting how long a taxi ride will take is crucial since users always want to know
precisely how long it will take them to get from one place to another, given the
growing popularity of using cab services through apps from companies like Ola and
Uber.
To guarantee customers choose them, companies must offer competitive pricing.
Users can plan their excursions more effectively with the help of trip time and cost
predictions, reducing the likelihood of traffic congestion. Additionally, it can assist
drivers in choosing the best route, which will take less time overall. Additionally, the
openness about the cost and duration of trips will help to draw customers during
peak periods when popular taxi app-based vendor services implement spike charges.
In order to anticipate the length and cost of a ride, we used real-time data that clients
would supply at the beginning of the ride or when making a reservation. This
information contains the location of the pick-up and drop-off points, the length of the
journey, the departure time, the number of passengers, and a rate code that
corresponds to one of the various cab classes, determining whether the rate charged
is regular or airport-based.
